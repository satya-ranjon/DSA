<h2 id="what-is-data-structure">Data Structure</h2>

A data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data on devices to use the data efficiently and effectively.

- **The main idea behind using the data structure is to minimize the time complexities.**

An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.

<h2 id="what-is-algorithms">Algorithms</h2>

Algorithm is defined as a process or set of well-defined instructions that are typically used to solve a particular group of problem or perform a specific type of calculation.

- **It is a set of operations performed in a step-by-step manner to execute a task.**

<h2 id="how-to-learn-data-structures-and-algorithms-from-scratch">How to start learning DSA?</h2>

The complete process to learn DSA from scratch can be broken into 4 parts:

1. Learn about Time and Space complexities
2. Learn the basics of individual Data Structures
3. Learn the basics of Algorithms
4. Practice Problems on DSA
