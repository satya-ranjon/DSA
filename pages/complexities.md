# Complexities

The primary purpose of using DSA is to solve the problem effectively and efficiently.
How can you decide if a program written by you is efficient.it is measured by complexity.

**Complications are two types:**

1. **_Time Complexity:_** Time complexity is used to measure the amount of time required to execute the code.
2. **_Space Complexity:_** Space complexity means the amount of space required to execute successfully the functionalities of the code.

In DSA the term auxillary space is used to refer to additional space used in the program other then the input data structure.

- The time required for executing a code depends on several factors, such as:
  - The number of operations preformed in the program,
  - The space of the device, and also,
  - The speed of data transfer if being executed on an online platform.

Then how to determine which one is efficient? The answer is the use of **_asymptotic notation._**

    Asymptotic notation is mathematical tool
    that calculates the time required in terms of the
    input size and does not required the code executed.

It neglects the system-dependent constants and is related to only the number of modular operation being performed in the whole program. The following 2 asymptotic notations are mostly used to represent the time complexity.

- **Big-O Notation (O) -** Big-O notation specifically describe the worst-case scenario.
- **Omega Notation (Ω) -** Omega (Ω) notation specifically describes the best-case scenario.
- **Theta Notation (θ) -** Theta (θ) notation represents the average complexity of an algorithm.
